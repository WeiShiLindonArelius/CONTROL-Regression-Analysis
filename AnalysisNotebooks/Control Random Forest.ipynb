    "The following data is generated from a separate Python project called CONTROL, in which teams play against one another in a fictional sport based on RNG. 8 groups of 100 play 10 matches against everyone within their group, keeping track of their wins and losses, for matches and lineups. (A match is made up of 8 Games between 8 different lineups. A Lineup Win/Loss is given for each of these Games, a Match Win/Loss is given if one team wins at least 5 Games, and a Match Draw is given to both teams if each team wins 4 Games. Regular season seeding (which is all we are concerned with at the moment) is based on Lineup win/loss rate.)\n",

In one of these iterations, all of the players will have identical values equal to the theory_team weighted averages. I suspect this team will win the overwhelming majority of its Games, upwards of 80%.\n",

The code in which I create these values and assign them to my model teams is shown below.
